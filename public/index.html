<blockquote>
<p>Motes played.</p>
<p>She played because she <em>was</em> play. She played because that was her role in life, because that is just who she was. She played with color, played with life, played with death.</p>
<p>She played with fire.</p>
<p>Motes played, because how could she not?</p>

<h3 id="note">Note</h3>
<p>This book relies on the plots of The Post-Self Cycle, particularly <a href="https://mitzvot.post-self.ink"><em>Mitzvot</em></a>. It is strongly recommended that you read those works first. They may all be found <a href="https://post-self.ink/cycle">here</a> as paperbacks, ebooks, and free to read in the browser.</p>
<p>The tilde (~) is the punctuation mark of whimsy and on this I will not be swayed.</p>
<h3 id="content-notes">Content notes:</h3>
<p>Contains mentions of rough, but consensual sex with one vague description; blood; adult characters engaging with the world as children, unrelated to sex; themes of familial abuse.</p>
