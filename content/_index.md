> Motes played.
> 
> She played because she *was* play. She played because that was her role in life, because that is just who she was. She played with color, played with life, played with death.
> 
> She played with fire.
> 
> Motes played, because how could she not?

### Content Notes

This book relies on the plots of The Post-Self Cycle, particularly [*Mitzvot*](https://mitzvot.post-self.ink). It is strongly recommended that you read those works first. They may all be found [here](https://post-self.ink/cycle) as paperbacks, ebooks, and free to read in the browser. If you would prefer to jump right in, spoilers be damned, you can find a primer [here](/primer).

The tilde (~) is the punctuation mark of whimsy and on this I will not be swayed.

Contains mentions of rough, but consensual sex with one vague description; blood; adult characters engaging with the world as children, unrelated to sex; themes of familial abuse.

## Advance Praise

> There's not that much literature out there that touches on this sort of 5-12 year old kidcore aesthetic and it was nice to see it done so beautifully. I absolutely loved it, it's up there with some of my favorite pieces.
