### Note

This book relies on the plots of The Post-Self Cycle, particularly [*Mitzvot*](https://mitzvot.post-self.ink). It is strongly recommended that you read those works first. They may all be found [here](https://post-self.ink/cycle) as paperbacks, ebooks, and free to read in the browser.

The tilde (~) is the punctuation mark of whimsy and on this I will not be swayed.

### Content warnings:

Mentions of rough, but consensual sex with one vague description; blood; themes of familial abuse; adult characters engaging with the world as children, unrelated to sex.
